Hello


[12/16/2022 21:20] ladboy233
@adamg @wilsoncusack I really think if the project could be more specific about which issues are explicitly out of scope, then auditor can focus on the cruical part of the in-scope contract. Thanks.


[12/16/2022 21:20] ladboy233
:chefskiss:


[12/16/2022 21:22] ladboy233
For example, this is my understanding: lack of Uniswap liqudity, oracle related external factor is out of scope.


[12/16/2022 21:22] ladboy233
Not sure about the "target values, mark values"😂


[12/16/2022 21:23] ladboy233
"but be aware that we are aware of many and are OK with the possibility." this makes the scope vague 🥲

[12/16/2022 21:28] wilsoncusack
If in doubt feel free to submit. We can remove that note if others are confused. It might make more sense after reading the whitepaper. In our previous audit we got many reports including trade offs that we felt were explicit in the protocol design. Eg we are trying to avoid getting many submissions with things like “if Uniswap liquidity is low and the funding period is very short, an attacker could sell a bunch of papr and cause liquidations”


[12/16/2022 21:29] wilsoncusack
I will try to think about how to phrase it more clearly or otherwise remove


[12/16/2022 22:01] wilsoncusack (pinned)
Made a video orienting a bit to the codebase. Lmk if this is helpful and if there’s anything else you’d want me to cover. Could also do a livestream so people could ask questions https://twitter.com/wilsoncusack/status/1603872305465155585?s=46&t=XSAHvZsy2Htp33dfzvFP7Q

[12/16/2022 22:13] trustminimised
I think what might help is, rather than rephrasing what you're not interested in, being more explicit about what you all are most concerned about? That would help me a lot.


[12/16/2022 22:17] wilsoncusack
Sure. Generally any violations of the assumptions of the protocol: only nft owners can mint debt, debt cannot exceed max LTV, only owner can withdraw their nft (except for liquidations), liquidations only occur if max LTV is violated, target and mark are updated correctly, reducing debt works, cannot withdraw nft if would cause vault to violate max debt.

[12/16/2022 22:19] wilsoncusack
I can add to the README. Generally we are open to any and all vulnerabilities in the in scope contracts. The note discussed above was intended to steer people away from lengthy hypotheticals that do not result in something that is clearly against the protocol design but is possibly just undesirable


[12/17/2022 06:42] dinesh11g
EXTERNAL IMPORTS were also in In-scope?

It appears that the user can specify the swap fee rate and the recipient of the swap fee, why this design?

🤔 

[12/19/2022 00:38] wilsoncusack
this is a fee specified by the client that is intended to incentivize the building of clients, Uniswap has something similar https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/base/PeripheryPaymentsWithFee.sol

generally we require `liquidationAuctionMinSpacing` between auctions. If the auction being purchased is the most recent, then we clear `latestAuctionStartTime` to allow a new auction to start

Hey, can I dm the judge for this contest? I just found out that I only received 1/6 the amount of another warden for the same vulnerability. If there's something wrong with my report, I would like to know so I don't make the same mistake again.


[01/21/2023 02:43] chaduke#3730
@evanthe one whose writing is included in the report will receive higher reward


[01/21/2023 02:43] chaduke#3730
maybe that is one reason


[01/21/2023 02:43] chaduke#3730
?


[01/21/2023 02:44] evan#9648
yea, and I think the judge can cut the reward by 1/2 or 1/4 if he thinks the report lacks detail. but I recall I did put in some effort writing that report
