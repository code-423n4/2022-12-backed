# ✨ So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the contest) 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (🐺)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (⭐️)**.

# Repo setup

## ⭐️ Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Provide a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 24 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a 🚨code freeze🚨 for the duration of the contest — important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the contest. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)


---

## ⭐️ Sponsor: Edit this README

Under "SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE" heading below, include the following:

- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation#readme))
  - [ ] When linking, please provide all links as full absolute links versus relative links
  - [ ] All information should be provided in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)
- [ ] Under the "Scope" heading, provide the name of each contract and:
  - [ ] source lines of code (excluding blank lines and comments) in each
  - [ ] external contracts called in each
  - [ ] libraries used in each
- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?
- [ ] Describe anything else that adds any special logic that makes your approach unique
- [ ] Identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

## C4udit / Publicly Known Issues

The C4audit output for the contest can be found [here](add link to report) within an hour of contest opening.

There are a number of known limitations that are out of scope for the contest 
- It is possible for a malicious/faulty pool to be passed to UniswapOracleFundingRateController
- Many things can go wrong in PaprController and NFTEDA if a malicious/faulty NFT is used
- Many things can go wrong in NFTEDA if a malicious/faulty ERC20 is used for payment asset
- Many things can go wrong in PaprController if a malicious/faulty ERC20 is used for `underlying`
- Additionally, there are myriad possibilities for the state of the system: Target values, Mark values, oracle prices, Uniswap liquidity, and more. We are open to hearing about possible adverse scenarios, but be aware that we are aware of many and are OK with the possibility. 

## Overview

Papr facilitates NFT-backed loans. Borrowers deposit allowlisted NFT collateral and mint papr, which can then be exchanged on Uniswap for some other asset. Papr interest rates and the papr trading price are in a constant feedback loop. Interest rates are programmatically updated on chain as a function of papr’s trading price on Uniswap (the lower the trading price, the higher the interest to borrowers), and interest rates in turn affect the trading price, as borrowers open and close loans in response to rates.


![loop_diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6678357/207438772-5bddff19-2b25-42d0-8eee-013fb8847fd2.png)

Interest accrues to the value of papr itself: over time, new borrowers are allowed less papr for the exact same collateral. When closing a loan, borrowers repay the exact same amount of papr that they minted. However, due to interest charges, it is expected that the market value of papr will have risen since they opened their loan.

To the extent that borrower incentives push the trading price of papr up over time, corresponding to these interest charges, papr holders are rewarded.

As an analogy, for those familiar with perpetuals, we can say that papr adapts the funding rate mechanism to set interest rates for loans and balance borrower and lender demand. In particular, papr tokens were heavily inspired by Squeeth, which pioneered perpetuals built on Uniswap V3 oracles and continuous, in-kind funding payments.

We *very strongly* encourage everyone to read our [whitepaper](https://backed.mirror.xyz/8SslPvU8of0h-fxoo6AybCpm51f30nd0qxPST8ep08c) to understand more!

## Scoping details answers
```
- If you have a public code repo, please share it here:  No, private right now
- How many contracts are in scope?: 14  
- Total SLoC for these contracts?:  1043
- How many external imports are there?: 11 
- How many separate interfaces and struct definitions are there for the contracts within scope?:  12
- Does most of your code generally use composition or inheritance?:   about 50/50
- How many external calls?:   5
- What is the overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests?:  80%
- Is there a need to understand a separate part of the codebase / get context in order to audit this part of the protocol?:   True

## Additional Context
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rWu_lWWhB6WVNjMe9dwTxmnQ77wtUIGFPFhpju1e49I/edit?usp=sharing) Is a simple Google Sheet you can play with to understand how Target changes in response to Mark and time. 

If you're using Slither, ensure you're using the latest version to avoid this sourceMap issue: crytic/crytic-compile#281. 

## Running code 
`foundryup` + `forge install` + `forge test` will get you up and going. (More info on Foundry [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)). Most of the PaprController tests are forking tests: relying on real chain state. To get these working, add an RPC url value (e.g. from Alchemy or Infura) for `MAINNET_RPC_URL` in a `.env` file or otherwise run `export MAINNET_RPC_URL=<your-mainnet-rpc-url-goes-here>`
